## INSTRUCTIONS

In your notebook write the following reactions in unitary manner.
The first one has been solved for your convinience.
You must write the reaction and then the answer as denoted by the first example.

1. $2H_{2} + O_{2} \rightarrow$ (write this too) <br>
  ANSWER: **2** moles of $H_{2}$ (hydrogen) reacts with **1** mole of $O_{2}$ (oxygen)

2. $N_{2} + 3H_{2} \rightarrow$

3. $2K + Cl_{2} \rightarrow$

4. $2Na + Br_{2} \rightarrow$

5. $CH_{4} + 2O_{2} \rightarrow$

6. $2Al + 3Cl_{2} \rightarrow$

7. $C_{3}H_{8} + 5O_{2} \rightarrow$

8. $2Mg + O_{2} \rightarrow$

9. $Zn + 2HCl \rightarrow$

10. $C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + 6O_{2} + ADP + P_{i} \rightarrow$

11. $NH_{3} + HCl + H_{2}O \rightarrow$

12. $Ca(OH)_{2} + CO_{2} + H_{2}O \rightarrow$

13. $Na_{2}CO_{3} + CaCl_{2} + H_{2}O \rightarrow$

14. $K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7} + H_{2}SO_{4} + H_{2}O + C_{2}H_{5}OH \rightarrow$

15. $Fe_{2}O_{3} + 3C + 3O_{2} \rightarrow$
